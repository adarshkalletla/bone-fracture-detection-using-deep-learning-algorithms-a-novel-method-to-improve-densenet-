Abstract—Bone fractures have emerged as prevalent issue in
 the medical field, and accurate, timely diagnosis of bone fractures
 is very important for effective treatment. Traditional methods for
 detection of bone fractures are subjective and time-consuming as
 they are dependent upon the expertise of radiologists. Application
 of deep learning techniques for automated bone fracture detec
tion helps us to overcome these challenges. A comparative anal
ysis of several Deep Learning algorithms, including GoogleNet,
 Xception, ResNet, DenseNet, Perceiver, and VGG16 models has
 been performed to identify fractured bones. Among the all
 models analysed,DenseNet displayed notable potential in effective
 detection of bone fractures due to its unique ability to effectively
 utilize features through dense connectivity. Additionally, a novel
 DenseNet-based model is proposed which enhances performance
 and aids in improved and efficient detection. The results obtained
 clearly demonstrates that proposed DenseNet model outperforms
 the traditional DenseNet architectures by achieving superior
 accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores.The performance of the
 models has been further analysed by plotting accuracy plots and
 loss plots for each of the studied models.
